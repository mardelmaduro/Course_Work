BudgIt is a personal budgeting application that allows users to track their personal financial activity. It creates a financial
summary based on the user's income, expenses, wishlist items, and total savings based on their income and expenses.
This is done by allowing the user to input various financial information and wanted items into the application.

Major Changes:
--------------
Structure â€“ Integration tests between seams were implemented in new integration package
          - Tests were grouped based on integration, unit, and acceptance tests
          - Objects now take advantage of polymorphism (used in Calculate)

Behaviour - Viewing financial summary before opening other pages (Wishlist, Income Sources, Expenses)
            now shows totals [Iteration 2 bug]
          - Drop down menu added in Income Sources (used to pick type)
          - Button added in Wishlist (removes item from Wishlist and add to Expenses if an item was bought)

Location of Database file (used to restore database if needed):
---------------------------------------------------------------
BUDGET.script found in databaseBackUp folder
    - app/databaseBackUp/BUDGET.script
